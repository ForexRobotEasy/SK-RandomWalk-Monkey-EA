# SK RandomWalk Monkey EA

This code is for the SK RandomWalk Monkey EA, a customizable expert advisor for trading in the forex market. The EA is developed by Forex Robot Easy Team and can be found on their website [forexroboteasy.com](https://forexroboteasy.com/forex-robot-review/sk-randomwalk-monkey-ea-review-beat-the-trade-game-with-customizable-features/). Please note that ForexRobotEasy is not the official developer of this product, and this code is provided as a sample that can work as described in the product.

## Customizable Settings

The following settings can be customized:

- `LotSize`: The lot size for each trade (default: 0.01).
- `StopLoss`: The stop loss in points for each trade (default: 50).
- `TakeProfit`: The take profit in points for each trade (default: 100).

To customize these settings, you can use the following functions:

- `SetLotSize(double size)`: Sets the lot size for each trade.
- `SetStopLoss(double stopLoss)`: Sets the stop loss in points for each trade.
- `SetTakeProfit(double takeProfit)`: Sets the take profit in points for each trade.

## Random Trade Function

The `RandomTrade()` function generates a random trade direction (0 for sell, 1 for buy) and executes the trade using the `OrderSend()` function. The trade is executed at the current market price, with stop loss and take profit levels calculated based on the customizable settings. The function returns -1 for sell trades and 1 for buy trades.

## Trade Function

The `Trade()` function is responsible for managing the trades. It calls the `RandomTrade()` function to execute a trade and then monitors the trade's profit. If the profit reaches the take profit level, the trade is closed with a profit. If the profit reaches the stop loss level, the trade is closed with a loss and the `RandomTrade()` function is called again to execute a new trade.

## Monitoring Market Trends

The `MonitorMarketTrends()` function is a placeholder for implementing your own market trend monitoring logic. You can customize this function to analyze market trends and determine whether to execute trades.

## Calculate Profit/Loss

The `CalculateProfitLoss()` function is a placeholder for implementing your own profit/loss calculation logic. You can customize this function to calculate the profit/loss of your trades.

## Expert Advisor Start Function

The `OnInit()` function is called when the expert advisor is initialized. You can initialize any necessary variables or resources here. The function should return `INIT_SUCCEEDED` to indicate successful initialization.

The `OnDeinit()` function is called when the expert advisor is deinitialized. You can clean up and deinitialize any resources here.

The `OnTick()` function is called on every tick of the market. It calls the `MonitorMarketTrends()` function to check market trends and executes trades accordingly.

The `OnTrade()` function is a placeholder for implementing your own trade event handling logic.

The `OnChartEvent()` function is a placeholder for implementing your own chart event handling logic.
